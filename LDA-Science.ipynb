    "Amazon SageMaker LDA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to describe a set of observations as a mixture of distinct categories. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is most commonly used to discover a user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text corpus. Here each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the topics. Since the method is unsupervised, the topics are not specified up front, and are not guaranteed to align with how a human may naturally categorize documents. The topics are learned as a probability distribution over the words that occur in each document. Each document, in turn, is described as a mixture of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is similar to **LDA-Introduction.ipynb** but its objective and scope are a different. We will be taking a deeper dive into the theory. The primary goals of this notebook are,\n",
    "\n",
    "* to understand the LDA model and the example dataset,\n",
    "* understand how the Amazon SageMaker LDA algorithm works,\n",
    "* interpret the meaning of the inference output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Former knowledge of LDA is not required. However, we will run through concepts rather quickly and at least a foundational knowledge of mathematics or machine learning is recommended. Suggested references are provided, as appropriate."

    "Also note that many real-word applications have large vocabulary sizes. It may be necessary to represent the input documents in sparse format. Finally, the use of stemming and lemmatization in data preprocessing provides several benefits. Doing so can improve training and inference compute time since it reduces the effective vocabulary size. More importantly, though, it can improve the quality of learned topic-word probability matrices and inferred topic mixtures. For example, the words *\"parliament\"*, *\"parliaments\"*, *\"parliamentary\"*, *\"parliament's\"*, and *\"parliamentarians\"* are all essentially the same word, *\"parliament\"*, but with different conjugations. For the purposes of detecting topics, such as a *\"politics\"* or *governments\"* topic, the inclusion of all five does not add much additional value as they all essentiall describe the same feature."
